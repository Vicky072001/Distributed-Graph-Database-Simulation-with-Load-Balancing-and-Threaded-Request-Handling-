1. Compile the files:

gcc load_balancer.c -o lb -pthread
gcc primary_server.c -o ps -pthread
gcc secondary_server.c -o ss -pthread
gcc client.c -o cl
gcc cleanup.c -o cup

2. Execute the binaries, each one in a separate terminal window:

./lb 201 202 203
./cl
./ps 201
./ss 202
./ss 203

3. Enter input in the client terminal window. 
- A graph must be added to the database via type 1 operation before performing 
any other operation on it. This is required for creation of semaphore for that 
graph (which will be deleted later).
- Output for bfs/dfs might take some seconds because of synchronization overheads.

4. Execute cleanup process in a new terminal window to terminate the running processes:

./cup 

5. Client process has to be terminated separately with Ctrl+C.
